    <h1 style="text-align: center; padding: 2%;">What Nature is...?</h1>
    <p style="padding: 2%; font-size: 15px;">The surroundings where we live, the natural resources or food we consume are parts of nature.
        Forests, hills, rivers, seas, deserts, weather etc. are part of nature.
        Nature provides us with opportunities to satisfy our needs and wants, such as water, air, food.
        Earth is the only known world that supports life for good and has biodiversity survival.
        The environment, the climate and the weather are part of nature and are important to us.
        Nature is also a major source of Ayurvedic medicines that have been used in the treatment of different common
        and fatal diseases for thousands of years..

        Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, material world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the
        phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only,
        part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category
        from other natural phenomena.

        The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential
        qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth". In ancient philosophy, natura
        is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the
        intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own
        accord. The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the
        original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers
        (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency
        ever since. During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the
        passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws. With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly
        became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by
        some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history
        (Hegel, Marx). However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the presocratic one, got reborn at the same time,
        especially after Charles Darwin

      <!-- Nature has an ecosystem consisting of biotic and abiotic components which are complementary and a part of nature.

        As for the protection of our plants, toxic pesticides shouldn't be used and the use of home remedies or other
        environmentally friendly tools should be encouraged.

        Human wellbeing is entirely connected to the health of the surrounding community. Nature is full of different
        resources responsible for our lives that are renewable and non-renewable.

        In reality, we can also use bicycles for a short distance, and protect our environment from the unnecessary
        release of harmful gases from our vehicles.

        Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to
        the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate
        objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and
        geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks,
        forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which
        persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not
        considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more
        traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural
        and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human
        consciousness or a human mind. Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also be
        distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural. -->
